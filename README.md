# Vox Obscura

*A browser-based narrative RPG set in the grimdark Warhammer 40K universe.*

Vox Obscura is a text-driven, choice-based adventure where you serve as an operative of the Inquisition—rooting out heresy, surviving forbidden worlds, and decoding fractured transmissions from the depths of Imperial space. Designed with modular systems and scalable architecture, the game blends interactive fiction with RPG elements like stats, gear, faction influence, and moral consequences.
