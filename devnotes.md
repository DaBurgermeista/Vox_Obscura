## ðŸ§  Stat Use Cases

### 1. Narrative Branching

Stats unlock alternate choices or increase success odds in events and encounters.

Example:
```js
{
  choice: "Wrench open the blast door",
  requires: { Strength: 3 },
  success: "You pry the door open with a grunt.",
  fail: "You strain, but it won't budge. The alarms keep shrieking."
}
